# Python uses Dynamic Typing.
# This means you can reassign variables to different data types.
#example of this would be
people_count = 2
print(people_count)
people_count = ["Jonathan", "Nathalie"]
print(people_count)
# end of example

# type() is available to check to see what the current data type is
print(type(people_count))
# end of example
